    "## Using `GenericLocation` to Define Flexible Regions on a Sequence\n",
    "\n",
    "`GenericLocation` in SBOL 2 is useful when regions on a sequence have flexible or undefined boundaries. This is often the case in situations where exact sequence positions are not available.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will start with a simple example to understand the basic usage of `GenericLocation`, and then link it to more complex use cases such as **Cre-Lox recombination**. `GenericLocation` becomes much more meaningful when combined with other SBOL concepts like `SequenceAnnotation`, `SequenceConstraint`, and `ComponentDefinition`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Minimal Example:**\n",
    "- We will create a DNA sequence and use `GenericLocation` to annotate a region without defined boundaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Practical Example:**\n",
    "- For a practical application of `GenericLocation` in modeling biological processes, see the [Cre-Lox Recombination Notebook](../CreLoxRecombination.ipynb), where `GenericLocation` is used to model flexible coding sequence boundaries in a recombination system."

    "In this minimal example, we used a `GenericLocation` to annotate a region on a sequence without specifying exact start and end positions. This approach is useful when the boundaries of a region are not well-defined or are subject to change. The `orientation` property of `GenericLocation` can be used to indicate the strand direction (inline or reverse complement).\n",
