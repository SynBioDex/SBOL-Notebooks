    "# SequenceAnnotation in pySBOL2\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we introduce the `SequenceAnnotation` class in SBOL 2. A `SequenceAnnotation` specifies regions of interest within a sequence by marking them with a location and (optionally) a functional role. This annotation provides valuable insights into the structural and functional elements of a `ComponentDefinition`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview of SequenceAnnotation Properties\n",
    "\n",
    "A `SequenceAnnotation` has a few key properties that allow it to describe specific regions within a sequence:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **location** (required): Defines the region within the sequence that the annotation applies to.\n",
    "   For more details on each location type, please refer to their respective notebooks:\n",
    "   - [Range Notebook](Range.ipynb)\n",
    "   - [Cut Notebook](Cut.ipynb)\n",
    "   - [GenericLocation Notebook](GenericLocation.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "   Additionally, see the [Cre-Lox Recombination Notebook](../CreLoxRecombination.ipynb) for a practical example of `GenericLocation` in action, modeling flexible coding sequence boundaries in a recombination system.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **component** (optional)\n",
    "\n",
    "The `component` property, if used, links the annotation to a specific `Component` in the same `ComponentDefinition`. This is helpful if you want the annotation to directly refer to a part of the designâ€™s structure, rather than just a sequence region.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **roles** (optional)\n",
    "\n",
    "The `roles` property is an optional list of URIs that describe the function of the annotated region (e.g., \"Promoter\" or \"Terminator\"). Using `roles` allows you to define what a sequence region *does*, without needing to associate it with a specific component. When a role is used, the sequenceAnnotation must not have a `component` property, as the annotation is describing the function on its own."
