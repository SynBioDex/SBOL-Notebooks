    "# Creating an Implementation Object\n",
    "\n",
    "An `Implementation` object represents an instance of a synthetic biological construct. It primarily describes the **build phase** of a design-build-test-learn workflow. An `Implementation` can refer to a physical laboratory sample that has already been built, or one that is planned to be built in the future. It can also represent virtual or simulated instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key properties of an `Implementation`:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `wasDerivedFrom`: Inherited from the `Identified` superclass, this property is used to link the `Implementation` back to its original design, which can be either a `ModuleDefinition` or a `ComponentDefinition`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `built`: This property is OPTIONAL and links to a `TopLevel` object (either a `ComponentDefinition` or `ModuleDefinition`) that describes the *actual physical structure and/or functional behavior* of the `Implementation`.\n",
    "    - If `built` refers to the **same** `ComponentDefinition`/`ModuleDefinition` as `wasDerivedFrom`, it implies that the actual structure/function of the `Implementation` matches its original design.\n",
    "    - If `built` refers to a **different** `ComponentDefinition`/`ModuleDefinition`, it indicates that the `Implementation` has deviated from the original design. This is useful for documenting scenarios like DNA sequencing results not matching the target sequence after assembly.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial will demonstrate how to create an `Implementation` that links to an original design and then to a *mutated* or *deviated* actual built construct, illustrating the use of both `wasDerivedFrom` and `built` properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more details, refer to Section 7.12 \"Implementation\" on page 52 in the SBOL specification (e.g., SBOL 2.3.0 or later)."
